This demo shows how to create a custo policy in Red Hat 3Scale using Camel-K.

Basically we have one microservices that shows data of a person and the second one shows data of a bank account. Those are independent microservices and the policy do the composition between those microservices and return the data from a person with their respective bank accounts.

Also it tooks a copy of that message and send to the topic `auditoria` in Kafka.
