# 3Scale Install with Operator

This guide looks to explore how to perform a 3scale installation in an Openshift 4 cluster using 
the 3Scale Operator.

In this scenario, I'll be using Postgres database outside OCP and Redis inside Openshift but out of the 
Operator management. 

== Install 

. Create a project
. Install the 3Scale Operator using the OLM

. Create the persistence volume (Just in case that you don't have a RWX volume option available)

    oc create -f system-storage.yaml

. Open the `apimanager.yaml` and update the `wildcardDomain`, and create it.

    oc create -f apimanager.yaml

. Create the RHSSO 

    oc new-app --template=sso74-ocp4-x509-postgresql-persistent


=== Creating your first API with 3Scale 

. Create a backend (public-banks)
.. Create the methods
.. Create the mapping rules

. Create a backend (private-banks)
.. Create the methods
.. Create the mapping rules

. Create the product 
.. associate the backends with the product 

. Create an application Plan 
.. Sandbox
... Create a rate limit of 10 request per minute
.. Production 

. Create an application (Audience > Select an Account > Click on the breadcrumb Application > Create Application)
.. Name it as atm-finder (8df307092ac9b717c5328401466d1748)
.. Select the production as the application plan 

. Create another application
.. Name it as wallet (0dc2bd78fb2303e13c094854105b3b51)
.. Select the sandbox as the application plan 

. Promote to staging
